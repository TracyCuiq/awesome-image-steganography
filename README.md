# awesome-image-steganography
Steganography is an art and science of invisible communication, achieved by hiding secret information in a cover object (image, audio, video, text). According to the communication cover/carrier forms, steganography can be classified into many categories: image steganography, audio steganography, video steganography, text steganography, and DNA-based steganography. Images are so widely used in communication. Therefore, we summarize a wide range of image steganography researches.
